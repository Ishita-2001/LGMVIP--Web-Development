      Steps:1. I have created a user card grid layout having a navbar showing any brand name.
            2. Added a button in the navbar saying 'Get Users', which makes an API call to get the user data.
            3. Used https://reqres.in/api/users?page=1 to get the data.
            4. Show a loader while the API fetches the data.
            5. Used custom CSS/SASS/styled-components.
